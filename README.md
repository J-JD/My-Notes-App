# [My Notes App](https://github.com/J-JD/My-Notes-App)

This is the __Notes App Project__ from the [Front-end for beginners](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/angular-developer) course on the [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/en/) platform. Each [commit](https://github.com/J-JD/My-Notes-App/commits/main/) coincides,
step by step, with the lessons where the project is developed.

This app was built using [Angular Framework](https://angular.io/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Some important aspects of this exercise have been the use of:
 + [Components](https://angular.io/guide/component-overview) to structure and organize the code.
 + [Design forms with validation](https://angular.io/guide/form-validation) to ensure data integrity, protect application data and avoid errors in the processing
 or storage of information.
 + [Angular routing](https://angular.io/guide/routing-overview) to handle navigation from one [view](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#view) to the next. Angular Router enables navigation by interpreting the
 browser [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL) as an instruction to change the view.

 All of this allows us to create easy-to-use applications with accessible and efficient interactions.

 Thanks and happy coding!
